# LWS project

Project that i've developed for the Web Scraping Laboratory course.
## objective
The main objecive of this project is to scrape data from blockchain transaction websites that allow the visuliaze anonimized movements inside the blockchain and use clustering algorithms in order to deanonimize movements.
The code is available inside the crafty.ipynb file and can be run, note that you need to download the dataset and in case you don't have the necessary amount of memory a data reducing script is provided in order to get a smaller version of the dataset.

The notebook is currently  in Italian.
